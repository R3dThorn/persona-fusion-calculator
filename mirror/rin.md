## Fog of War (draft)

As tempting as it was to try and contemplate the frankly *absurd* numbers of coincidences and lapses of judgement — her own and *especially* of that one person's — that have led her to her current location and situation, the Tohsaka heiress didn't have attention to waste in reminiscence at the moment.

After all, it would plain suicidal to lower her guard as outnumbered as she was by magi of unknown power and skill after the first shot was already fired.

Fortunately, Rin's adversaries seemed as confused by her presence in their territory as she felt after accidentally trespassing into it. It wasn't surprising, really. Boundary Fields aren't supposed to suddenly become permeable without being forced to collapse first unless the correct entrance ritual was performed. Something she certainly didn't even try to accomplish.

Still, their confusion couldn't last for much longer. If this place was a magus' Workshop — his or her *Sanctum Sanctorum* — as the concentration of ambient mana suggested, then it was well within the practitioner's rights to employ lethal force as punitive action against intruders. A prerogative she would surely had already embraced were the roles reversed.

Magecraft's secrecy doesn't just keep the knowledge of the Art beyond the non-magi population. A magus is even more cautious of revealing too much of his or her Mysteries to another magus. Not even the magus' family is an exception to this rule.

That thought led Rin to realize another anomaly: Why are there so many magi in here?

A magus only shares his or her Workshop with *an* heir or heiress. Indefinite article, singular noun. No matter the availability of potential apprentices with the right affinities and number and quality of Magic Circuits, a magus doesn't train more than one because only one person can bear a Magic Crest at a time.

Rin knows this harsh truth better than most magi.

*'A Cabal then?'* Rin wondered. If a group of magi had gathered to pool together their power and resources, either for the sake of a single ritual or a more long-term goal like the Einzbern, Makiri and Tohsaka families did two hundreds years ago with the Heaven's Feel ritual, then this could mean major problems for her besides the immediate ones.

Even assuming that she managed to kill all five opponents and figure out a way to escape the Boundary Field, Rin had no way to know who else was involved or how well connected any of them could be. If anyone involved in this Cabal belonged to the Mage's Association, then news of her intrusion into their Workshop would badly damage her reputation and her chances of entry to the Clock Tower.

While the Tohsaka magus weighted her options, somebody else made the next move. "Who the hell are you?" a tall person asked.

As focused as she was on her mystical senses and, in turn, on the ineffable quality of the power humming within the magi's bodies, it took Rin a moment to realize that the voice belonged to a man. She assessed him while keeping passive track of everybody else, especially the other sole male to the left who had nimbly dodged her opening Gandr shot.

The result of her analysis wasn't promising. The man who addressed her was tall and muscular. His posture didn't suggested a martial training to speak of, but his bearing and the way he balanced his weight on his feet matched someone experienced in a purely physical fight.  

Without any warning the ground under her feet glowed green, a reticular pattern drawn with some unidentified energy emerged from it and surrounded her. Rin didn't stand still to find out what the spell was supposed to accomplish, but its wide area of effect and the limited speed of her un-Reinforced body ensured that she was still caught by it.

Tohsaka flooded her Circuits with prana, preparing herself to fend off whatever foreign energies were casted on her before they could try to take hold, at the same time she casted Reinforcement on her arms, legs and clothes.

She was surprised when her prana flowed unhindered. Had the caster botched the spell? Or was her innate resistance just too much for it? Or—?

Her train of thought almost derailed when a wall of fire appeared in the direction she was running to.

*'—A feint,'* Rin deduced and darted to her right and away from her opponents and parallel to the wall of fire for a short while before changing direction. And then again and again. Being a moving target without a predictable trajectory is always advisable in a battle against ranged attacks, Magecraft or not.

The whisper of a massive shift in the air alerted her that something was fast approaching her from… above? Rin rolled to the side and a figure stomped on the ground she was about to stand on.

The Tohsaka magus didn't bother to check which one of her enemies has the capability to jump that far or how. She simply took a large amount of the previously generated prana still in her Circuits to give form to an overpowered Gandr over her open hand and then hurled it into the figure with a palm strike.

*'Better safe than sorry,'* her magus mindset reassured her conscience as her spell made contact. The resulting explosion *disintegrated* the target, which gave Rin a pause. She didn't have firsthand experience using a Gandr of that size and power against a living subject, but she hypothesized that, while still lethal, her attack should be orders of magnitude below the level of energy necessary to inflict that kind of damage.

Confounding matters further, immediately following the explosion, a pained scream cut through her thoughts. Rin tried to track the origin of the male voice with her eyes, but mana-saturated atmosphere within the Boundary Field made difficult to see with any clarity beyond certain distance.  

"Oh, that's it!" said the same man who spoke to her before. "I'm kicking her ass! *Persona!*"

"Wait, Kanji-kun! Himiko's analysis says she's human!" warned an oddly familiar female voice.

"Then we're making Twintails apologize for knocking out Yosuke!" added a second female voice.

*'It's a two side-up—,'* some idle part of the Tohsaka magus' mind chided until she felt a ticking sensation on her skin, something like static charge building up in the air. Without a second thought, she dashed towards the source of voices as electric discharges crackled behind her every step.

Rin clinically noted that she probably shouldn't have bothered dodging the spell as it didn't seem to carry enough voltage and amperage to harm her too badly through her Reinforcement, but she needed to get closer to her enemies because, for some reason, they didn't seem to have much trouble targeting her through the fog-like atmosphere and the danger of friendly fire should keep them from using area denial spells like the wall of fire from before or this lightning-based spell just now.  

The first of her enemies to come into view was the girl around her age with a brown hair and wearing something like highly decorated shin pads over her legs. Rin felt somewhat entitled to label the girl as 'Bob Cut' in her mind after being (incorrectly) nicknamed her by her haircut.

As expected, Bob Cut seemed to know where she was coming from and was already running straight to meet her head-on. However Rin didn't anticipate that the girl would drop her body at the last second and use her momentum to slide along the ground, feet-first in her direction.

The manoeuvre taken right out of a baseball or soccer player caught Rin by surprise and her knee-jerk reaction was to jump over Bob Cut to avoid her sliding tackle. That proved to be a mistake when Bob Cut's descending form uncovered the sight of a round Greek shield, of all things, launched like an oversized flying toy disc in collision course with her rising body.

Even Reinforcing her body beyond human limitations doesn't mean a thing if she doesn't have the purchase to convert that strength and speed into movement. In the middle of the air, only simply Newtonian physics dictated her trajectory.

Still, that doesn't mean a magus like Rin doesn't have a way to stack the laws of movement in her favor.

One of the preferred spells of her late father and magic teacher was a tampering field that diminished the effect of gravity over the caster's body. He had used it to descend into battle with the dignity and grace a magus of the Tohsaka family is ought to display.

Unlike Tokiomi Tohsaka, she instead force-fed the spell with as much prana as possible to compensate for casting it with the most abbreviated incantation she had tried for it so far. It was an incredible crude affair, nevertheless the spell let Rin effectively ignore her vertical deceleration for probably two seconds.

It didn't increase her absolute speed at all, but it did alter the shape of her expected trajectory from a parabolic arc into a 70 degree ascending straight line for a short while. That, together with some inelegant contortions allowed Rin vault over the improvised projectile for maybe an inch and a half.  

Any sense of triumph vanished when the man — the one apparently called Kanji by process of elimination — casted a spell with a shout of "*Masukunda!*"

Expended as she was after her gravity-repelling stunt, Rin's Magic Circuits didn't have the prana to wash off his spell before it could come into effect. That, together with the awkward posture she was left in after her dodging manoeuvre, didn't give her another option than to roll on the ground to bleed off the momentum of her jump, which keep her from running away from the curse's area of effect.

Suddenly everything around the Tohsaka magus moved in double-time.

Bob Cut quickly got on her feet and ran towards her faster than what seemed possible just a few seconds ago.

Rin's martial arts training under Kirei's guidance recognized the way Bob Cut put her left foot on the ground as the obvious tell preceding a side-snap kick. The angle of her right leg plus Rin's own unprepared stance told her that Bob Cut was planing to knock her out cold with a quick kick to her left temple.

For the first time during the fight, Rin felt real fear trickling down her spine. Under any circumstance one must not fall unconscious within an enemy magus' Workshop. The risks of becoming an specimen, kept alive only for experimentation or in pieces as *ingredients*, are just too great and terrible for consideration.

"No, you won't," Rin said, her first spoken words since crossing the Boundary Field. Forgoing conscious thought, the Tohsaka magus kicked the ground regardless her less-than-ideal footing and lunged towards her attacker, setting her upper body to block the kick with her left arm and plant a right elbow strike on her solar plexus at the same time.

Somehow Bob Cut reacted in time to use the spin of her own kick to twist her body out of the way of Rin's attack. The kick still connected with her left arm, but Bob Cut's dodging left her bereft of adequate purchase to put too much strength behind it. Rin followed through with the blow to diminish that strength even further as she charged a retaliatory Gandr shot aimed at the girl.  

She didn't get the chance to fire it, though.

The man appeared behind her and simply shoved her hard like an overgrown kindergarten's bully to a much smaller child. It irked her how effective it was. His superior mass, firm stance and the fact he placed both hands on her back and as close as he could to her center of mass meant that she had no other choice but having to interrupt the casting and effectively be sent flying into the air.

As she readied herself for landing and counterattack, Rin's affinity with fire magic as one of the very few magi bearing the title of the *Average One* warned her that a spell of the element was being prepared to ambush her the moment she touched the ground.

Rin gritted her teeth. *'This is going to be* expensive*',* she thought.

Bitting back something between a snarl and a sigh, Rin tossed a sapphire at the ground in front of her. "*Acht!*" she commanded and the jewel broke, releasing weeks' worth of her spare Od in a instant.

Fire and ice magic actualized at the same time, magically excited and slowed down molecules fighting for dominance over the same space. To her chagrin, Rin had overestimated the amount of prana behind the enemy's spell, her own ice magic overpowering it and conjuring sharp and jagged frozen shapes ready to impale her to the ground.

Without better options, the Tohsaka magus put all the prana she could into her Reinforcement spells and resigned herself to simply bull through the still-forming ice. She curled up into a ball to minimize the surface of her body exposed to harm, pressing her limbs onto her torso and guarding her face with her arms.

Fortunately, the damage received was negligible, nothing worse than a few shallow cuts in her forearms and shins, none of them serious enough to draw blood. Her clothing, on the other hand, wasn't so lucky.

Rin Tohsaka realized that she had unconsciously diverted more prana to Reinforce her body than her clothes, resulting in the ragged bits of fabric formerly known as her thighhighs clinging to her shoes. Her sleeves of her red turtleneck around the forearms didn't fare much better, but her skirt was thankfully spared from any damage.  

For some reason, the four enemy magi simply stared at Rin, giving her some respite. She didn't try to reach for another jewel just yet; such action would surely spur her enemies to attack. Instead, the Tohsaka magus took advantage of the lull in the battle to catch her breath and reassess her opponents after subtly casting Reinforcement on her eyes and ears.

Her prana-infused sight could now penetrate deeper into the fog, but not to the extent she was hoping for. There was also the option of focusing her sight on a specific point to perceive more details, but that was akin to try to turn her eyes into built-in binoculars and limiting her field of view like that would spell disaster for her as outnumbered as she was.

Rin could now clearly see Bob Cut and the man with sunglasses standing around 6 meters away from her. The former bounced lightly on her feet, squinting at her behind her yellow-rimmed glasses. The latter blinked owlishly at her, circling slowly to her right and keeping his distance. 

Another five meters or so behind the man's current position, Rin could now barely discern the silhouettes of two girls.

The shorter of the two had her hair tied in two pigtails and held her hands in a way that remembered her of how most people prayed during church service by intertwining their fingers. Behind her there was a tall ethereal agglomeration of mystical energy that Rin couldn't make any detail of, but it didn't strike her as dangerous for some reason.

The taller girl had a long, obviously darker, straight hair that reached down until the middle of her back. Much like herself, she was dressed in red and black but before the Tohsaka magus could take in any more details, two things happened simultaneously.

First, the long-haired girl reached down and placed her hands on a third figure laying supine on the ground that Rin hadn't noticed until now — probably the second guy that screamed and passed out for not obvious reason a subjectively endless minute ago.

Second, the man with the bleached hair cut into the silence again. "Rise, call Senpai!" newly nicknamed 'Yankee' snapped loudly, but without daring to take his eyes off of Rin.

"I'm trying, but he's outside communication range. I think he's still pep-taking Teddie…" 'Pigtails' said in a voice that Rin once again found strangely familiar.

"How far?" Bob Cut interrupted.

"The studio," the girl answered.

"I'll take care of that," 'Brunette' assured as she got back to her feet. "Buy me a min—"

"Watch out!" Pigtails shouted.  

The instant Yankee had said the verb 'call,' and thus implying the existence of even more enemies within the Boundary Field, Rin was already releasing the metaphorical locks of the Tohsaka Family's Magic Crest.

The following seconds were expended methodically regulating the influx of prana coming from the comparative enormous reserves in her Crest, flowing just slowly enough for the other magi to not immediately notice the presence of new power in her Circuits nor the glowing on her now exposed left forearm that normally signalized the active state of her Crest until too late.

At the same time, she gauged the threat level of each of the four magi opposing her and as a team. They seemed to be organized in a simple vanguard/rearguard set up: Yankee and Bob Cut handled the close quarters combat, Pigtails and Brunette acted as support.

The rest of the time, Rin cursed her luck. Outnumbered 4 to 1 in the middle of enemy territory? On a featureless landscape without cover or escape route? Trapped with limited supplies and no backup when the same couldn't be said of her opponents?

*'Time to level the field,'* she decided.

Without any movement or warning, Rin deliberately over-Reinforced the pouch on her belt where she carried about half of the jewels on her person. The fabric soon became saturated with prana and ruptured not unlike a rubber balloon in slow motion. As her precious stones fell on the ground, Rin caught one with the instep of her right foot and kicked it in Yankee's direction at the same time Pigtails shouted her warning.

Even as she ran towards Bob Cut, the Tohsaka magus kept her eyes on Yankee — and her Reinforced ears on everybody else — and took notice of his widening eyes as he realized her gambit.

After she had used ice-elemental magic, Yankee unconsciously put himself between her and the two girls in the rearguard. That fact suggested to Rin that he didn't want her casting a spell of the element on his support, meaning that an attack like that would be most likely very effective against at least one of them.

That had left Yankee with only two options: Deal with the attack himself, or dodge and expose the two girls and his fallen companion behind him to it.

Granted, Rin actually had no idea what type of gem she had just kicked or how much energy was stored inside, but she knew Yankee *didn't* know, which was enough for her purposes.  

Then something completely unexpected happened.

With a click of his tongue, Yankee backhanded empty air. During the course of his right arm's movement, a bluish flame appeared in the middle of his fist's trajectory, breaking with a glass-like cracking sound on contact.

Suddenly a humanoid figure, probably twice his height and surrounded by the same bluish flame, appeared in front of Yankee and stood in a defensive posture, ready to guard against the incoming projectile.

Rin wasn't sure what to think about the development, but the magus prodigy pushed her mind into overtime to try to make sense of it.

Was that Yankee's Familiar? If so, how did it appear out of thin air? Familiars can be crafted from a myriad of 'raw materials', from dead animals reanimated by left-over thoughts, to a Spirit or Demon bound by a contract and anything in-between. Her own 'Owls', for example, are a somewhat unusual variant — small automata made of amethyst, effectively only good for reconnaissance purposes.

Inconceivable as it may sound, a *Heroic Spirit* summoned by the Holy Grail in Fuyuki does qualify as a Familiar, even if just out of a technicality.

From what she saw of Yankee's creature, it wasn't made out of organic tissue. Its golem-like appearance — an allegorical design that wouldn't look out of place in a *Día de Muertos* parade — suggested a crafting technique closer to the one she used to make her Owls statues. However the way how Yankee called it forth ruled out that possibility entirely. It's simply unfeasible to craft an automaton that big and complex on the spot, unless… Alchemy?

The Thaumaturgical School of Alchemy focuses its studies around the flow of matter and the conversion of matter to and from more exotic phenomena. Supposedly, magi from the Einzbern family were so skilled at it generations ago that they could create incredibly intricate life-like constructs, either as makeshift puppets or outright humanoid Homunculi.

Assuming that her hypothesis was correct, what was a magus with a talent as rare as Yankee's doing here and dressed as, well, an stereotypical Japanese delinquent, or 'yankee' for short?  

Regardless the tumult of new information and educated guesses in her mind, Rin's course of action was ironically quite simple: "*Sieben!*" she snapped a moment before her magically-charged gemstone could hit the Familiar.

The resulting firestorm engulfed the construct with scorching red flames and she tallied one good-sized ruby down for the count. As engrossed as she was with her thoughts, Rin almost forgot was she was doing, and more importantly, whose direction she was running to.

To her credit, Bob Cut didn't allow her ally's pained grunts nor the explosive assault on his Familiar to distract her from the approaching Tohsaka magus and threw a roundhouse kick in her way. The attack was ill-timed, though; too hasty. Rin only had to swift her upper body a little to the side to completely avoid it.

It was only when she was about to capitalize on opening on Bob Cut's lumbar area that Rin realized the kick wasn't aimed at her in the first place. Preceded again by the sound of glass breaking, the unlikely happened one more time.

Another towering construct — this one a lot more anthropomorphic than the previous one dressed in a formfitting yellow jumpsuit, white boots, flared armored skirt and a pointed helmet — materialized in front of Rin, already swinging a two-bladed spear at her in a counterclockwise and ascending strike.

"Protect me, Tomoe!" the other magus cried out.

Luckily, or perhaps deliberately if the enemy magi were planing on capturing her alive, Rin was hit by the flat side of the blade on her left arm, just below the shoulder. Apparently Bob Cut took notice of her evident toughness when hitting the ice and the blow carried enough strength to break her left arm and probably crack several ribs were her body not so throughly Reinforced.

Bob Cut seemed to have a predilection to send her enemies into the air, but this time the Tohsaka magus was prepared. While still airborne, Rin finally permitted her Crest to operate at full capacity. Tattoo-like lines drawn in an elaborate pattern, no two lines ever crossing each other, shinned with a bright turquoise color on her exposed left forearm.  

That was the only warning Rin gave her enemies of her next move. Not a second later she unleashed a veritable *barrage* of Gandr shots on the yellow Familiar and its master with as much mercy and rate of fire as one would expect from a machine gun.

Bob Cut instinctively dived behind her construct at the same time that it blocked most of the Finn shots with a spinning flourish of its spear. Still, the quality of the *quantity* of the attack ensured that roughly 1 out of 10 projectiles landed on target, each hit on the Familiar accompanied by a pained response from the enemy magus.

Tohsaka had to fight down a cry of 'Eureka!' as something that had been nagging at her for a while finally clicked into place.

Normally, a magus doesn't try to craft a combat Familiar. Not because it's not possible, but because it's not worth the effort unless the raw materials are already battle-capable in the first place.

After all, who has the time to teach a mindless stone dummy to throw a punch or a set of bones to swing a sword correctly anyway? And even if you do, what is the point of it if the results are likely lackluster at best when there are many more efficient ways available to accomplish the same objectives? For example, a half-decent Boundary Field is a lot more useful than a dozen of dimwitted sentries for a fraction of the prana cost.

Also, there is the problem of control. If a magus binds a Spirit or Demon or even a large animal intelligent and powerful enough to be useful in battle, the Familiar is equally if not more dangerous to the master were the bindings to slip for even a moment. There is a good reason why most Familiars are crafted from creatures that would normally qualify as pets.

In the Alchemists' case, Rin deduced that Yankee and Bob Cut had worked around these problems by using their own central nervous systems as part of the underlying mechanisms of their constructs, making them essentially extensions of their own bodies. On the bright side, it means that the Familiars' combat proficiency as in fact their masters' own, meaning that no progress is lost if the construct were to be destroyed, and loyalty becomes a non-issue.

On the down side, such a display of puppetry can't be easy to accomplish, which bears the question of how much time and training the Alchemists had devoted to their Magecraft considering their apparent age and it might explain why the constructs were crafted into humanoid shapes in the first place — any other anatomical configuration would surely be a lot more difficult to master without obvious parallels to their own hard-wired somatic feedback and responses.

The problem with their approach is that Yankee and Bob Cut evidently had to create a Thaumaturgical Link, or *Pass* for short, between their Familiars and their very own *nerve endings*. That had to be the reason why Yankee showed signs of pain after the ruby exploded over his Familiar and why Bob Cut did the same every time hers got hit by a Gandr shot, her reaction even matching the placement of the impacts.

This fact also explained why the other male magus went down without Rin even coming close to him and why his allies got mad at her after it happened: the thing she had obliterated with that overloaded Finn shot was *that magus' Familiar* and the sensory backlash knocked him out cold. That being the case, then—  

Naturally, her enemies wouldn't stay idle for a moment longer.

"Don't give up!" Pigtails cheered and in response the purplish glow of a spell washed over Bob Cut and her Familiar.

"My turn," Bob Cut announced and Rin could just hear the grin implied in her voice. "Tomoe, *Gale Slash!*"

The yellow construct dismissed defense, allowing Rin to land several Gandr potshots on it, but for some reason the Familiar now simply shrugged them off as it performed some sort of staff-themed martial *kata* with its double-bladed spear.

Rin never saw the blow of empty air before it hit her and for an instant her world turned white. The moment died a painful death when a second vacuum slash connected with her head again. It was pure self-preservation what made her jump to the side to avoid the third one and cover her ears.

The Tohsaka magus didn't know whether Bob Cut planned for it or not, but her Reinforced hearing had just backfired on her horribly. It wasn't a problem when she knew a shock wave was coming and she had the presence of mind to keep her mouth open to equalize the air pressure at both sides of her eardrums. That was exactly what she did before when her ruby exploded.

However, the ranged technique of this 'Tomoe' was capable of creating a localized barometric depression around her head that had popped her ears, which thanks to the hypersensibility granted by her Reinforcement felt like someone had just tried to pull out her eardrums with medieval tools even if no actual harm was done.

It took all her magus' self-discipline to ignore the pain and focus on her enemy. Rin saw the girl with the yellow-rimmed glassed blink in surprise at the effectiveness of her Familiar's attack and order it to try it out again.  

Forewarned and more than a little angry, the Tohsaka magus decided that things would turn out differently this time. She diverted prana to her legs and right arm and grabbed a topaz and a garnet from her skirt pockets with her left and right hands, respectively.

The moment Tomoe stood its ground and restarted its kata, Rin dashed towards it at full speed and then hurled her topaz at it, her running adding up to her throwing speed. "*Sechs!*" she shouted, her own voice still sounding strange to her ears, when the stone was flying midway between her and the construct.

The gem released its stored magical energies as an undirected wind spell that shallowed up the travelling low pressure air waves that composed the construct's technique, effectively countering them. Rin paid no mind to that, though.

Without missing a step, she placed the garnet on the center of her cupped-up right hand, her thumb touching the left side of her index right finger and casted a specific protective charm on her skin with a short incantation in addition to her already present Reinforcement. Preparations complete, she thrust out her right arm to the side as she rushed beside Tomoe.

"*Fünf!*" the Tohsaka magus snarled. The fire-elemental magic broke free from its container, but not in its raw form this time. Rin actively guided the superheated energies reflecting them on the concave-shaped fire-repellent mystic field over her right hand. The flame of her impromptu blowtorch burned bright and with pinpoint precision through the Familiar's right knee. The construct shuddered in apparent pain, but Rin didn't pay any attention to that, either.

Only when *Bob Cut* cried out in agony and doubled up by reflex to cover her undamaged right knee with both hands, Rin flashed a shit-eating grin that would have traumatized any of her classmates at Homurahara High School on sight. Unprepared, the female Alchemist barely had time to widen her eyes when she saw the heel of a shoe fast-approaching to her face after the Tohsaka magus had turned the linear momentum of her sprint into a textbook flying kick.

The blow connected with her enemy's forehead with such force that Rin was surprised that the girl's neck didn't snapped. She guessed that Pigtails' protective spell plus some personal Reinforcement had something to do with that. Still, the kick tossed Bob Cut at least two meters away like a rag doll, unconsciousness claiming her long before her limp body could hit the ground. At the same time that Bob Cut passed out, her yellow construct vanished with the same glass-breaking noise from before.

For her part, Rin was forced to backflip after the collision to put her legs under herself. She managed to land on her feet, but a lot less gracefully than she expected, her hair rushing to cover her face as a result.

"And that's why…" Rin said to her downed opponent between gasps, "you don't make… a voodoo doll… of yourself… baka," she finished almost in a sigh.  

Rin pulled her hair out of her face looked for her next opponents. The fog made the task more challenging that it should, but using her Reinforced sight to methodically observe small areas of her field of view at a time yielded positive results not five seconds later.

What she saw there remembered her of the adage 'Winning a Battle, Losing the War.'

During her fight with Bob Cut, a *fourth* Alchemical construct had been materialized. This one was also anthropomorphic and crafted in more obviously female proportions, evident even at the distance thanks to its… cheerleader outfit?

She had barely managed to take in the sight of the feathery pink and red ornamental garment that it wore attached to both of its wrists and flaring out behind it not entirely unlike a shawl when the Familiar took off for the skies and *stood there.*

The Tohsaka magus tried to work out thaumaturgical principles involved in the process — perhaps a gravity-tampering enchantment casted with a delay plus something else to launch the construct that high and a third spell for additional lift and axial control? —, only for her mind to stop in its tracks when her magical senses told her that the Familiar was manipulating massive amounts of ambient mana for a fire spell.

Therefore, this Familiar evidently had *Magic Circuits*.

Corollary: this *Alchemical construct* was technically a *magus*.

More to the point, it was a *flying* magus with access to *powerful fire-elemental Magecraft* in a *mana-saturated environment*.

By the time her mind had put to adjective 'Magical' in front of the noun *'Bombardment'*, Rin was already in her way to take out the construct's master before it could get all Fire and Brimstone to her Sodom and Gomorrah. By process of elimination, she knew it was either Pigtails or Brunette. Just to be on the safe side, she decided to deal with both of them at the same time.

Remembering her previous yet-unproved hypothesis about at least one of last two enemy magi being apparently vulnerable to ice-elemental magic, the Tohsaka magus put her last sapphire on her right hand without breaking stride and prepared her Magic Crest for another round of Gandr shots as a distraction, just to keep the small gemstone from being noticed behind the covering fire of materialized curses until too late.

Once she got close enough, Rin set her metaphorical sights on the two girls and pulled the trigger.  

"*Persona!*" roared a basso.

Yankee's large Familiar appeared out of thin air in front of the girls — legs slightly bent, arms held open and downwards, just like a soccer goalie — completely blocking her line of fire to the female magi.

Rin felt tempted to growl in frustration. While she could in fact bend the trajectory of her projectiles to avoid the construct and home in on the target, that kind of aiming takes preparation and her affinity to the fire element was screaming at her that whatever the flying Familiar about to unleash would happen sooner than that.

Running to either side to get a clear line of fire wasn't a good solution. The Familiar stood closer to Pigtails and Brunette than to her, meaning that simple trigonometry allowed the construct to compensate for the diminished angular variation and keep the line of fire blocked without too much effort. It also *didn't* stand *too* closely to the girls, meaning that the Tohsaka magus had no hope of killing three birds with one stone that way.

If running neither left or right was a feasible course of action, Rin decided to settle for her last option on the table and, once again, took the faster route to her target. As pressed for time as she was, only one idea, an admittedly very *childish* one occurred to her.

Rin closed her left hand into a fist and when she got within a 6-meter range from Yankee's Familiar, she performed an underhand pitch straight out from what she remembered from the softball games during P.E. in middle school with a shout of "Mata nuki!"

Controlled by its master's will — and thus a *human* mind —, the construct recognized the meaning of her words and quickly dropped to its knees, buckling its lower limbs inwards to ostensibly keep her from tossing a gemstone between its legs. It didn't stop there, though. As the distance between them decreased, the Familiar leaned forward and brought its arms together to try and swat her between its enormous hands like a mosquito before she could alter her heading.

The Tohsaka magus didn't fight down the grin that appeared on her face when everything turned out better than she expected.

Wherever he was, Yankee had just instructed his construct to make two mistakes. First, to kneel. Second, to lean forward. Both actions greatly reduced its mobility and effective height, making vaulting over the Familiar with her Reinforced legs and hurl her sapphire in her *right* hand that much easier. For good measure, Rin also prepped her Crest to unleash another Gandr shot barrage at the construct and the girls.

That's why she wasn't prepared for the sight of Yankee swatting her gem aside, barely an instant after it had left her hand, using the same round shield that almost hit her a subjective eternity ago. "There it goes!" he laughed, triumph dripping from his voice.

In one of those adrenaline-fueled moments during battle that seemed extraordinarily longer than it really was, the Tohsaka magus and the Alchemist locked stares as she leaped over the Familiar's right shoulder, their faces passing probably not half of an arm's length away from each other but none of them was yet ready to make their next moves.

She observed that he was standing on his Familiar, shield in hand with one foot on its left shoulder and the other on the occipital surface of its bowed head. The image made her think of a conqueror of old posing for his men on a tumbled down, larger-than-lifesize statue of his fallen enemy.

It took Rin a second to put together what had just happened — Yankee had either realized her trick or simply climbed up on his construct's back to get the drop on her using its body as concealment and found himself in the right place and time to get rid of her last sapphire.

Just to rub salt in the wound, the flying Familiar completed its spell and the fireworks started.  

Rin felt like cursing at the guy. Instead, she went about it literally and fired Gandr shots at him the moment her feet touched the ground again. He didn't remain idle, though. By the time the first Finn shot hit his shield guarding his head, the rest of his body had already disappeared behind his Familiar's as he jumped off of it. She settled for shooting on its back, knowing that Yankee must be feeling the attack on his own body through the Pass in some capacity.

The Alchemical construct rotated its body clockwise, faster than its size and awkward posture would suggest, as if to try to backhand her. The Tohsaka magus had already considered that possibility and she kept herself out of its arms' reach. However she had no way to know about the huge lightning-shaped, electrically-charged golden sword the Familiar would swing at her with its left hand.

Just like Bob Cut before him, Yankee used the flat of the blade of his construct's weapon to bludgeon her instead of going for the killing blow and, once again, Rin was sent flying away.

While airborne, with something between begrudging admiration and hateful frustration, the Tohsaka magus realized that weapons the Alchemical constructs wielded had to be Alchemical constructs too. It made sense for those magi to be able to craft them as easily and swiftly as they crafted their Familiars, if not more.

And then a *second* flying Familiar drop-kicked her at an enormous speed, mightily hammering her down onto the ground under a sky ignited with fire just like a Summer Festival during an unusual cloudy night.

Rin spared no bit of prana in her Circuits and Crest to cast as many protective charms as possible and Reinforce her body to such extent that her own spell had good chances of killing her if the inertia didn't do her in first.

Regardless of her efforts to remain conscious, darkness welcomed the Tohsaka magus with considerable more mercy than the unforgiving ground.

The first thing Yosuke saw after opening his eyes was Amagi's beautiful face above his, her eyes closed in concentration, her head tilted forward and her long hair falling like a dark waterfall and covering a good chunk of the right side of his field of view.

It wasn't a lap pillow, but a guy could get used to waking up like that anyways.

The second thing to catch his attention was Rise's unmistakable voice. "—side communication range. I think he's still pep-taking Teddie…" she said, tension of battle obvious in her voice.

Yosuke frowned. *'What it's going on?'* he thought groggily.

"How far?" Chie asked somewhere.

"The studio."

"I'll take care of that," Amagi said and stood up. Yosuke tried to avert his eyes from the upskirt view of her black pantyhose-clad legs (*'honest!'*), but he discovered he couldn't move his neck and instead he shut his eyelids as quickly as he could (*'cross my heart!'*).

"Watch out!" Rise warned.

By this point of the days and battles of the Investigation Team, when any of its members put that much urgency in their voice, the rest snaps into action before any conscious decision could be made. Or try to, as it was the case for the unofficial 'Junes Prince' in this occasion.

Most of his body was outright refusing to obey him with sadly familiar numbness. Yosuke wondered how he got so beaten up and suddenly the memories came back to him.

After school, Emiya had said he wanted to revisit the Club area of the TV World for loot, Fusion fodder and to get some training done, but Teddie inexplicably refused to go there. Yosuke guessed it was probably because of something scary the bear had watched on late TV last night. Damn cable-TV. Emiya stood behind to reassure and talk some sense to him and the rest of them simply went ahead to avoid wasting any more time.

In their merry way to the Club, they had run into a girl around their age. Quite a looker in fact, just the right balance of cuteness and class in her features and bearing in Yosuke's opinion. The problem being, of course, you don't run into *people* in the TV World.

The sight of her came so out of the left field that the five present members of the Investigation Team couldn't help but begin calling forth their Personas. The girl somehow noticed this and soon enough pointed the fingers of her open palm at the closest of them and some sort of dark energy bullet fired out of her hand.

Yosuke's luck being what it is, her target was naturally his very own person. He instantly jumped to the side to avoid the attack, but neither him or anyone else in the team replied in kind. It took him a moment to realize the reason: they had just gotten too used to Emiya being the one calling the shots when facing something new and unknown.

Kanji and Rise were the first ones to snap out of it and the idol used her Persona to get some data on the 'girl' with the black ribbons, but she quickly ran to try to avoid the scanning, which was a first in his experience.

The girl began to pick up speed as she ran and Yosuke frowned. If she kept running in that direction, she was likely to eventually run into Emiya and Teddie and caught them off guard. Amagi seemed to be on the same page as him and used Maragi to block her path.

For his part, Yosuke didn't stand with his arms crossed and used the superior speed of Jiraiya to do the same when the irregular pattern of her mad dash threatened to go to the TV World Entrance again.

He miscalculated. The girl with the black ribbons had just picked up the pace into truly ludicrous speed and his Persona almost landed on top of her instead of ahead of her as he intended.

She managed to avoid being trampled under his Persona's feet and the last thing Yosuke remembered before passing out was the sight of her through Jiraiya's eyes as she fired the anti-tank version of her previous attack at his other self.

Back to the present, Yosuke now realized that Amagi had just used her Persona to forcefully bring him back from la-la land.

It wasn't an all-powerful skill, though. If someone or something just kicked your ass six ways to Sunday, 'Recarm' wakes you up and let you *feel* like someone or something just kicked your ass six ways to Sunday.

Yosuke was about to ask the innkeeper — maybe petulantly, to be honest with himself — why she didn't finish the job and healed him up fully when the exchange of words between the girls finally clicked into place: Amagi wanted to call in the calvary in her own pyromaniac way and she wanted it done *now.*

The teenager boy no way to know how things went while he was out for the count, but from just that fact the safest bet to make was 'not very good'.

Getting back on his feet was now the top priority, but without his friends' help that left him with only one alternative on the table: his own Persona's sole and very weak healing spell, 'Dia.'

With time being always of the essence, especially in a still-unknown battlefield, Yosuke went about healing himself in the most efficient way he could: the sorcerer's way.

According to the Investigation Team's resident wizard, the correct mindset is one of most important things when wizarding, often life-or-death important. Yosuke had dismissed his phony-sounding guru-like advice until he connected his words with the stunt Satonaka had pulled off to finish off Amagi's Shadow.

Emiya had tried to explain it with smarter-sounding words in his own magician's terms, but the bottom line was that, if the Persona User actively participates in doing magic instead of leaving all the work to the Persona, the results are a _doozy_.

Yosuke emptied his mind of thoughts. It wasn't something that came easily to him, but there was a way to cheat about it. Instead falling slowly into a meditative state, dismissing any lingering thoughts and concerns one by one as Emiya had described, he focuses all his thoughts on his Persona, his consciousness reaching out for him.

His other self, Jiraiya.

The spy, the assassin, the myth.

*'It's a contradiction, isn't it? A famous spook?'* Yosuke wondered, his question echoing within the confines of his mind.

*{Prudent man fears the hidden threat in the shadows: the unseen eyes, ears and hands. Clever man wields his own against his enemies, becomes part of the shadows. Wise man uses his own and that of his enemies as his own, tells artful lies to the shadows, becomes their master. Hidden threat is unknown, fear of unknown threat is not.}*

*'Huh?'*

*{Later. Your allies need you now.}*

*'Right. So, um… an extra large order of Dia with a side of Sukukaja?'*

*{Let us rest, recover and rise.}*

* * *

Yosuke opened his eyes again some time later. He didn't waste another second laying down and jumped to his feet. He found his twin daggers within easy reach on the ground and picked them up with his right foot just like a juggler would do with his props and into his waiting hands.

"Where?" he demanded.

"She's coming that way!" Rise replied immediately as if expecting the question, and pointed a finger at Kanji's Persona,

Yosuke couldn't see behind Take-Mikazuchi's back, but that wasn't much of a problem if you can have a second pair of eyes watching everything from above. The founding member of the Investigation Team willed his Persona card into being and slashed it with his kunai.

Jiraiya heeded his calling and took off for the skies like a silent rocket. The aerial view of the battlefield told him that their enemy was running straight at the god of thunder and firing the machine gun version of her dark energy attack at him. 

Kanji's body language as he stood at some distance behind his Persona seemed to say that the brawler was itching for getting up close and personal with his opponent but he couldn't find a way to go about it because of the bullet hell the twintailed beauty was unleashing.

"*Sukukaja!*" Yosuke invoked. For a briefest of moments, Kanji looked at his body in confusion as the greenish energies of Jiraiya's skill washed over him, but then he smirked and sprinted towards Take-Mikazuchi with his enhanced speed.

To Yosuke's surprise, the brawler used his newfound dexterity to jump onto his Persona's back using the latter's ankle and posterior as stepping stones, already swinging his shield with both hands at the same time the dark magical shooter leaped to jump over Kanji's Persona.

At that precise moment the sky ignited with color and fire and Jiraiya — and by extension Yosuke himself — lost track of everything going on for a few seconds. When the two of them recovered their senses, Take-Mikazuchi was swinging his sword at their enemy.

Recognizing just what was about to happen, Yosuke saw the opportunity for a very painful bit of ironic playback. He directed his Persona to pick up as much speed as possible while dashing feet-first and straight downwards. When the ribbon-wearing menace was sent flying by Kanji's Persona, Jiraiya made the final adjustments to his fall and landed with pinpoint accuracy on top of her.

Yosuke wished someone had brought a camera to record the meteoric collision of their enemy against the ground. Clouds of dust erupted around ground zero and he could even felt the resulting impact tremors on his feet.

Still, being the Investigation Team's enemies what they are, Yosuke didn't dare to lower his guard until he saw the latest one vanish into dark mist with his own eyes. He called forth the wind with his Persona's skill Magaru to clean the view from dust and get a good sight of the girl-shaped Shadow prone on the ground.

Amazingly, it was still in one piece, but from the sound of the hurried steps of his friend approaching the crash site, Yosuke knew there was an easy solution to that.

It was always a pleasure to be the one calling for an all-out attack, and Yosuke didn't want to miss the chance. "Just in time, guys! Let's kill it w—!"

"W-Wait!" shouted Kanji in a panic.

"Eh?!" Yosuke complained in a very reproachful voice. "What are you waiting for? If it gets up, it will—"

"She is *human*, Yosuke-senpai," Rise cut in, her coarse voice hinting that she was holding back… tears?

Yosuke felt like someone had just short circuited his brain.

The idol called forth her persona and they used their powers to scan the prone form of… the girl? Seriously?

Everybody stood in tense silence for a long moment until Rise sighed in relief. "She's alive. No broken bones, but… her body is weird. Human, but… wait. It's almost like Se—"

His knives fell from his trembling hands and landed on the ground with a loud pair of clacks. *'Holy shit,'* Yosuke swore in his thoughts. *'That was close. So damn* close*…'*

"—mind that," Kanji said and Yosuke realized that he had just missed part of the conversation. "But what we do now?"

"Let's wait for Senpai. He's the one who knows about this kind of things," Rise suggested. "Himiko says he saw Yukiko-senpai's signal on the sky. He and Teddie are coming this way now."

"I agree." Kanji nodded. "Yukiko-senpai, can you heal h—? Eek!" he tried but his question ended with a surprisingly high-pitched expression of alarm.

Yosuke didn't blame him. The last present member of the Investigation Team who had remained quiet so far was glaring daggers at the prone figure with such animosity that he was half-expecting her to literally catch fire.

"Chie first," Amagi stated, her outright *glacial* tone of voice giving absolutely no room for arguments. "You guys should restrain her, or something."

"H-How?" Kanji stammered, the brawler managing to sound nervous, incredulous and honestly curious all at once.

"Try duct tape and a sock," the innkeeper proposed flatly. "Rise-chan, where is Chie?"

"R-Right!" the idol agreed at once. "I'll take you to her, Yukiko-senpai. This way!"

Yosuke waited until he couldn't hear the sound of their steps trotting away to ask the obvious question.

"*Yikes!* What was _that_ about?" he asked. "I've never seen Amagi so angry before, not even in your bathhouse."

"…" Kanji stared flatly at him.

"Okay, not talking about the Bathhouse Incident. But seriously, the hell?"

Kanji sighed and rubbed his temples with his right hand. "She," he said and pointed at the unconscious girl with his chin, "defeated Chie-senpai with a *nasty* piece of flying kick to the head. Rise-senpai's Persona told us she's fine, but…"

Yosuke didn't have to be told twice. The fastest and surest way to make an enemy out of Satonaka or Amagi is mess with the other. Still, the implications of what Kanji just said…

"… for real? Satonaka. KO'd. With a *kick*?" Yosuke had to ask.

Kanji simply nodded.

"Holy Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris…" Yosuke breathed out. From what he witnessed of the battle, the Yasogami sophomore had thought that the Sha— er, girl was only good at running away, taking hits and shooting at things. If she was that much of a brawler to beat Satonaka in her own speciality, they maybe it would be for the best if they took some precautions.

"Say Kanji, got any duct tape?" Yosuke asked, sounding unnerved.

"Eh?"

"I mean, do you know any way we can tie up this girl before she wakes up?" Yosuke repeated his question at length.

"…"

"What?"

"You know," Kanji begun in a lecturing tone, "from all the questions I'm expected to answer in life, that ain't one."

Before Yosuke could find something to say to *that*, the two young men heard something noisily approaching their location.

Something with an engine.

"HEY!" Kanji shouted, instantly recognizing the mechanical rumble.

"OVER HERE!" Yosuke seconded and ran to meet the late-arriving calvary.

Normally, it's very difficult to look badass when arriving to a fight on a hand-me-down, feet-forward old scooter with less than 275cc of displacement that it'd look more at home in a low budget made-for-TV teenager chick flick.

Emiya pulled it off by virtue of appearing out of the fog riding without hands — both of them obviously too busy setting two arrows in his bow as he aimed forwards, bowstring tensing and now ready to shoot at a moment's notice —, carrying a sheathed katana in his hip and a quiver in his back and the extra style points given by the Tron-lines currently shinning all over his bike.

Teddie didn't pull any punches either. The bear got to the scene on his roller skates and cheering a gleeful "Woohoo~!" as he grabbed onto an improvised tow-rope with his left paw while the other end of the line was being pulled by the jaws of a striped tiger running in front of him at full gallop. Just for the record, the large feline was naturally on fire.

The leader of the Investigation Team commanded his Sun Arcana Persona to give the rope a tug to the left — probably to make it easier for Teddie to brake — before dismissing Gdon entirely. The bear skidded into halt like a hockey player, with surprising grace given his top-heavy form.

For his part, Emiya himself couldn't easily stop his bike without placing his otherwise-occupied hands on the handlebar, so he simply unmounted out of it with a jump, but not before making a Persona card appear in the way of his leap.

He broke the card with a nonchalant headbutt of the half-helmet he received from his uncle together with the scooter and the Persona Oni appeared behind him, already in-flight and matching his forward speed.

The red-skinned horned demon grabbed him by the back of Emiya's clothes with his right hand as one might do with a bratty kindergarten kid and placed Emiya on the ground, who somehow didn't break stride and managed to maintain his ready-to-fire posture with his bow and arrows as he kept scanning the premises.

At the same time, the now-riderless machine tumbled on its side and screeched on the ground until it made a full-stop, but not looking worse-for-wear despite the abuse thanks to the spell the teenager magus had the foresight to cast on it.

Yosuke didn't gaped. Cool guys don't gape in awe at his friends.

"Hell yeah, Boss!" Kanji cooed, not getting the memo.

The Junes' employee was about to crack a joke about reinforcements always being late for everything when he saw the expression on his friend's face behind his fog-filtering glasses. The magus was in full battle-mode. Like the naked blade of a sword, Shirou Emiya was ready to cut down the, in his mind, still lurking threat to his friends.

"We're fine! We're fine!" Yosuke quickly reassured him, waving his hands in a placating gesture. "Everything is under control now!"

Emiya blinked. A moment later that seemed longer than it really was, he let out a breath he didn't know he was holding and lowered his bow. "Is anyone hurt?" he asked.

"Chie-senpai took a bit of a beating," Kanji explained. Yosuke didn't miss the fact he was downplaying what the brawler just told him and he couldn't help but share the sentiment. Their team leader simply does _not_ take well when someone else gets badly hurt. "The girls are healing her up now."

The magus frowned, mostly to himself, and asked "What happened?"

"Long story short, we ran into someone strong. We fought, we won," Yosuke summed up.

"Then why did Amagi-san use the emergency signal?"

"Getting to that," he amended. "Things got hairy at one point and Amagi thought it was better to be safe than sorry. Nothing we couldn't handle in the end, though."

"Wait, Yosuke," Emiya cut in, closed his eyes for a few moments and then opened them again. "Did something happened to _you_, specifically?"

"Er… why do you ask?"

Looking at little embarrassed, the magus made a face and pointed at his own head. "Hua Po," he said, as if stating the name of his palm-sized Persona of the Magician Arcana explained everything…

… Which it did, Yosuke realized with a start. _'Freaking Social Links,'_ he groused in his head.

"Ugh, what is she saying?" he asked cautiously.

"Hua Po is a tree spirit. She can't really talk, but she communicates through birdsongs," the Wild Card explained. "She's now singing a soulful melody. Sad. Regretful, but not _too_ regretful. I'm sorry, I don't know if I can really explain it…"

"Yeah…" Yosuke sighed. Bracing himself, he added, "Well, noticed when I said before we fought some*one* strong, I didn't say some*thing* strong?"

Emiya now looked completely out of his depth. He remained quiet instead of making any questions, though, silently encouraging his friend to elaborate.

As the silence stretched, Kanji decided that he had waited enough. "One of 'em mages got in here."

""What?!"" Shirou and Yosuke blurted out in unison. "Do you mean a *magus*"/"She was a *wizard*?" they added, respectively.

Kanji didn't seem to know which question answer first for a moment, but then he apparently realized that he could simply kill two birds with one stone.

"Yeah, that. Rise-senpai says she's human but inside she looked a lot like you, Senpai, with all this magical wiring thingy."

"When did Kujikawa-san scanned my---?" Emiya begun and then shook his head. "Never mind that now. Did she say 'Magic Circuits'? Are you _certain_?" he asked with pressing urgency.

"Yes," Kanji confirmed at once.

"And you just defeated her?"

"Yes."

"We have to get her out of here _now_." the leader of the Investigation Team stated. Yosuke could just _hear_ the tightly suppressed surge of panic in his voice.

"W-Why?" Kanji mumbled, obviously catching on the fact that something serious was going on, but incapable of figuring out what it was.

"Magi don't think like normal people," Emiya explained. "They don't even think as most *ab*normal people. There's no time for explanations, but the bottom line is: if _hers_ gets out, I have absolutely _no idea_ what's going to happen."

Yosuke and Kanji looked at each other, realization dawning on their faces at the same time:

Her Shadow.

If someone without a Persona enters the TV World, sooner or later his or her _other self_ appears. If the Shadow is rejected...

"Where is she?" Shirou Emiya urged.

""T-There!"" Yosuke and Kanji replied at the same time. ""In the crater!""

Emiya followed where their fingers pointed. "There's nothing there," he said.

"Heh?" Yosuke uttered and snapped his neck to look in the direction he was pointing.

In that precise moment of collective distraction, a blur dashed across the fog and got behind the team leader before anyone could react.

A left foot appeared between Shirou's legs and back-kicked the left one backwards at the same time a right knee pushed his own forward, forcing his body to turn counterclockwise as his own weight forced his left knee onto the ground. A left hand pulled hard on the fabric of the back of his shirt below the left armpit and a shoulder dug itself onto his scapula, pouring even more spin into the rotation.

A right hand held a kunai on Emiya's neck, the blade firmly pressed on his skin and precisely placed to puncture his right carotid artery at the slightest provocation.

"Don't even think on Reinforcing yourself," a female voice warned in a faux-peppy tone. "I _will_ know and that will be, well, icky."

Yosuke watched through his widening eyes at the battered figure of the female magus holding Shirou's at knifepoint --- to his horror, _his_ own forgotten knife.

"Now," she said nonchalantly. "Let's talk."
