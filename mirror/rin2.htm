  <h2>Fog of War, part 2 (draft)</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>The first thing to welcome Rin back to consciousness was an intense and all-encompassing sensation of pin-and-needles coming from her every muscle. It wasn't really what a magus would call 'painful' per se, but it certainly was an incapacitating and unpleasant condition to wake up to and, sadly enough, not one too unfamiliar for the Tohsaka heiress.</p>

  <p>From her previous experiences with overworked Magic Circuits and failed experiments, Rin automatically set herself about ignoring the systemic pseudo-paresthesia and focused on her sense of touch, vaguely realizing that she was laying face-down on the hard, cold and&hellip; irregular floor of her Workshop? <em>'That's new,'</em> she thought groggily.</p>

  <p>When a spell backfires that badly on her despite her numerous precautions &mdash; especially one of the many magical puzzles her father wisely left behind for her just in case she would be <em>left alone</em> to progress with her Thaumaturgical education after the Fourth Holy Grail War &mdash;, she usually manages to escape from the blast radius before getting too hurt herself.</p>

  <p>That wasn't the case this time, obviously.</p>

  <p>Rin tried to open her eyes and get on her feet, but her body was simply refusing to obey, not even her <em>eyelids</em> were listening to her brain's commands. <em>'Okay, this could be bad&hellip;'</em> Rin thought cautiously as she tried to suppress the spike of a familiar but insurmountable terror making itself known.</p>

  <p>Like a well-worn pair of shoes, the fear of <em>dying alone</em> on her Workshop's floor while practicing the Art or in one of the <em>large and cold rooms</em> of the Tohsaka manor to a more mundane danger <em>without anyone noticing</em> her missing for God only knows how much time settled coldly yet comfortably in her heart.</p>

  <p>After all, it was a scenario that had played out over and over in her head for the last ten years: What if she makes a fatal mistake during her Magecraft self-training and research? Or worse, what if the accident is <em>not</em> immediately lethal? That would mean perhaps days of a possible, if not likely, slow and agonizing demise to a myriad of potential causes.</p>

  <p>Depending on the time of the year, it could take Homurahara's staff between 48 hours to several weeks before informing her legal guardian about her unjustified absence and Rin simply didn't know how long it would take for a rather untalented practitioner like the fake priest to get around the defences of her house and Workshop before finding her.</p>

  <p>Of course, it's <em>not</em> like an easy death is <em>really an option</em> for the Tohsaka heiress. The accumulated Thaumaturgical knowledge of her predecessors materialized in her Magic Crest simply won't let her die until passed down to her own successor and it will resort to truly drastic measures to keep her alive, especially true if a life-threatening event occurs in her house and therefore within easy access to one of Fuyuki's main Leylines under her purview as the Second Owner.</p>

  <p>To put it mildly, there is a good reason why she knows the basics of a magical procedure that could replace a major organ like a heart with an artificial equivalent if she was willing to expend most of her gems or her inherited pendant to accomplish it.</p>

  <p>The fact her Magic Crest wasn't 'acting up' at the moment was a good sign &mdash; it meant that the extent of her injuries didn't warranted a more direct and invasive intervention from its part. Still, an accurate assessment of the damage received was in order and Rin devoted all her senses, mystical and otherwise, to the task.</p>

  <p>Her low prana and Od levels was the first thing she noticed. Either whatever she was doing before losing consciousness had drained her reserves dry or her Crest had in fact already intervened in her behalf while she was asleep and depleted the magical energies to do it.</p>

  <p>Her physical condition was a bit of mixed bag: Good news was that she didn't have any broken bones, ruptured organs nor internal bleeding. Bad news, there was evidence that a small but not inconsiderable amount of prana had leaked from her Circuits and run amok through part of her somatic nervous system.</p>

  <p>The damage wasn't too severe &mdash; Rin wasn't looking forward to the muscle cramps that she was likely to experience for probably an entire week after this, though &mdash;, but the traces of prana still lingering in her efferent nerves would keep her under effective paralysis until she did something about it.</p>

  <p>As the Tohsaka magus was preparing herself to 'ground' the stray magical energies back to her Circuits and recover mobility, she felt something through her still-mostly numbed sense of touch that made her heart try to jump out of her chest in fright:</p>

  <p>A pair of hands turning her body over into a supine position.</p>
